Howdy, I'm Vince.
My current loves are web design and visual minimalism.
It's usually the small details that spark my interests.
{:intro}

I'm a senior at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, pursuing computer science and business management. I spend my time <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialfoodplug/" target="_blank">posting food</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/VincentNavarro" target="_blank">coding</a>,
and <a href="/blog" target="_blank">writing</a> from time to time.

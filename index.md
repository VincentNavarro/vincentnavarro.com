<p id="intro">
   Howdy, I'm Vince.
   My current loves are web design and visual minimalism.
   It's usually the small details that spark my interests.

<p class="meat">
   I'm currently living in Las Vegas, Nevada as a student.
   Previously, I've freelanced as:
   a brand ambassador for <a href="https://www.ioblabs.com" target="_blank">iOB Labs</a>,
   an Instagram consultant for <a href="https://chasingtitles.us/" target="_blank">ChasingTitles</a>,
   a website coordinator for <a href="http://modelingstop.com/" target="_blank">ModelingStop</a>
   , <a href="/portfolio">etc</a>.
   I specialize in brand exposure: audience maintenance, A/B testing, and consistency through platforms and actions.
